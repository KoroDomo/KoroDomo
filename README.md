- 👋 Hi, I’m @KoroDomo
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding, Anime, Movies & TV Series and Gaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS, next JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's related to basic C# and Java coding, which are the programming language I feel the most knowledgable using at the moment 
and QA Automation which I don't have professional experience but really looking forward to land a job opportunity towards that area. I also have some basic knowledge on C and C++.
- 📫 How to reach me: dioris.adp@gmail.com
